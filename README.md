# CIS 433 Group Project
This repository contains the code for the Facial Recognition Authentication System used in the project, as well as the [images](/images.zip) used for testing.

It requires [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi) (HttpClient & HttpCore & CommonsLogging) and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to compile. A [compiled jar](/FRASv2.1.jar) is provided.

## Notes
* The CAM button for using a webcam to add images is unimplemented
* Place the application alongside the images, as it defaults to the current working directory when adding an image
